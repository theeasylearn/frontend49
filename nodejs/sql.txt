how to update all rows 
---------------------------
we can update one or more field in single update statement.

update tablename set field-name-1 = value, [field-name-2 =value]

example
update all person's salary, set salary to 50000
update person set salary=50000

update all person'salary by 999 rupees
update person set salary = salary + 999



how to update specific rows 
-----------------------------
update tablename set field-name-1 = value, [field-name-2 =value] where condition

example
update email,name,weight  of person whose name is Diya patel 

update person set email='diya_ankit_patel@gmail.com',fullname='Diya Ankit Patel',weight=50.99 where fullname='diya patel'

update salary by 10000 of person whose id is below 5
update person set salary=salary+10000 where id<5

update person set salary = salary * 0.90  where id>=6 and id<=10

update salary to 100000 of those employee whose birth date in 2005
update person set salary=100000 where dob>='2005-01-01' and dob<='2005-12-31'



how to fetch data from table(s)?
-----------------------------------
to fetch data from table(s), we use select sql command. select command is read only sql command, it can not change/update date into table


select *|<fieldnames> from tablesname [where condition] [group by fieldname ] [having condition] [order by fieldname] [limit offset]

fetch all fields & rows from customers 
select * from customers

fetch 1st 50 customers detail 
select * from customers limit 0,50

fetch next 50 customers detail 
select * from customers limit 50,50

fetch next 25 customers detail 
select * from customers limit 100,25

fetch specific field(s)
fetch customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit of all customers
select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers


fetch only rows as per condition (filtering)

fetch customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit of those customer who are from usa.
select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers where country='usa'

fetch 1st 10 customer's customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit of those customer who are from usa.
select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers where country='usa' limit 0,10



fetch customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit of those customer who are from usa or france or spain or australia

select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers where country='usa' or country='france' or country='spain' or country='australia'

or 

select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers where country in ('usa','france','spain','australia')

fetch customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit of those customer who are from not living in usa, france, spain, australia

select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers where country !=
'usa' and country !='france' and country !='spain' and country!='australia'

OR 

select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers where country  not in ('usa','france','spain','australia')

fetch customerNumber,customerName,creditLimit of those customer whose credit limit is between 1 and 3 lakh 

select customerNumber,customerName,creditLimit from customers where creditLimit>=100000 and creditLimit<=300000

OR 

select customerNumber,customerName,creditLimit from customers where creditLimit between 100000 and 300000


fetch customerNumber,customerName,creditLimit of those customer whose credit limit is between below lakh or greater then 3 lakh

select customerNumber,customerName,creditLimit from customers where creditLimit<100000 or creditLimit>300000


fetch customerNumber & name of those customer whose name contains wheels 

select customerNumber,customerName from customers where name like '%wheels%'


fetch customerNumber & name of those customer whose name start with wheels 
select customerNumber,customerName from customers where customerName like 'wheels%'

fetch customerNumber & name of those customer whose name ends with wheels 
select customerNumber,customerName from customers where customerName like '%wheels'

fetch payment detail of those customers who have made payment in 2005
select * from payments where paymentdate >='2005-01-01' and paymentdate<='2005-12-31'
 or 
select * from payments where paymentdate between '2005-01-01' and '2005-12-31'
or 
select * from payments where left(paymentdate,4) = '2005'

how to display data in particular field's sequence (order)

by default any select sql command without order by clause, always display data in order of insertion means old row will be displayed first and new row will be displayed last.
to display in specific seuquence we should use order by clause followed by field name. 
display customernumber,customername from customers customer name ascending order (a to z) 
select customernumber,customername from customers order by customerName


display customernumber,customername from customers customer name descending order  (z to a)
select customernumber,customername from customers order by customerName descending

select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state from customer table  and display it 1st country then state wise and then city wise

select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state from customers order by country,state,city

fetch customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit of those customer who are from not living in usa, france, spain, australia and display it creditLimit wise desending order 

select customerNumber,customerName,city,country,state,creditLimit from customers where country not in ('Australia','usa','france','spain') order by creditLimit desc

fetch top 10 customers customer creditlimit wise in descending order 

select * from customers order by creditLimit desc limit 0,10

fetch top 10 payments of year 2005

select * from payments where paymentdate between '2005-01-01' and '2005-12-31'  order by amount desc limit 0,10;
 
select customerNumber,customerName,country of 1st five customers from USA.

select customerNumber,customerName,country from customers where country='usa' limit 0,5

fetch last customer data 
select * from customers order by customerNumber desc limit 0,1

fetch 2nd 3rd and 4th last customer data 
select * from customers order by customerNumber desc limit 1,3

fetch 10 payments detail with least payment amount
select * from payments order by amount limit 0,10

aggrigate function
-----------------------------------------------
function that work upon numeric field of table and always return single value is called aggrigate function

sum()
it always return sum of numeric fields value 
example
findout total payment amount
select sum(amount) from payments 

avg()
it always return average of numeric fields value 

example
findout average payment amount 
select avg(amount) as average_payment from payments

min()
it always return minimum of numeric fields value 
example
findout least payment amount 
select min(amount) as minimum_payment from payments

max()
it always return maximum of numeric fields value 
example
findout maximum payment amount 
select max(amount) as maximum_payment from payments  

count()
it count no of values in table 
example 
findout how many products company has 
select count(*) as 'total_products' from products;


findout how many customer company has 
select count(*) as no_of_customers from customers;

findout total no of orders company received
select count(*) as no_of_orders from orders;

Caution
---------------------------------
never use normal field along with aggrigate function. otherwise there will provide misleading output.
example 
findout customerNumber who has made minimum payment 
select customerNumber,min(amount) as minimum_payment from payments  

-------------------------------------
we can also where and other statement with aggrigate function 
findout total payment amount paid by customerNumber 112

select sum(amount) from payments where customerNumber = 112

findout no of payments, and average payment amount & total payment amount paid by customerNumber 114
select count(*) as 'no_of_payment', avg(amount) as average_amount, sum(amount) as 'total_amount' from payments where customerNumber=114

handling null 
findout no of payments, and average payment amount & total payment amount paid by customerNumber 113
select count(*) as 'no_of_payment', ifnull(avg(amount),0) as average_amount, COALESCE(sum(amount),0) as 'total_amount' from payments where customerNumber=113;


findout total payment, no of payment received in 2005
select ifnull(sum(amount),0) as total ,count(*) as 'no_of_payment' from payments where paymentdate between '2005-01-01' and '2005-12-31'


findout no of cancelled orders 
select count(*) as 'cancelled_orders' from orders where status='cancelled'

group by 
-------------------------
    group by clause is when we want to get sub total/group on repetative fields value.
    group by clause should be used with aggrigate function 
    field we use with group clause should be also displayed

findout no of orders cancelled, shipped, Disputed, in process etc 
select status,count(*) from orders group by status

findout no of customers from each country, show them in descending order 
select count(*), country from customers group by country order by count(*) desc 

findout total payment amount paid by each customers 
select customerNumber,sum(amount) from payments group by customerNumber

findout total payment amount made in each year 
select sum(amount),left(paymentdate,4) from payments group by left(paymentdate,4)

findout no of orders received by each customers and display them in descending order 
select customerNumber,count(*) from orders group by customerNumber order by count(*) desc;

display top 10 customer by payments 
select customerNumber,sum(amount) from payments group by customerNumber order by sum(amount) desc limit 0,10

display top 10 customer by orders count 
select count(*),customerNumber from orders group by customerNumber order by count(*) desc limit 0,10

having 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
having clause is used to give condition on aggrigate function's group by value. 
having caluse is always used only when select statement has aggrigate functions & group by clause. 

fetch customerNumber and total payment amount of those customer who have paid more then 500000 total
select customerNumber,sum(amount) as 'total_amount' from payments group by customerNumber having sum(amount)>50000


fetch country and no of customers from country where customers count is above 10 and display them in descending order of count
select country,count(*) from customers group by country having count(*)>10 order by count(*) desc

fetch no of order of each customers whose no of orders less then 5
select customerNumber,count(*) from orders group by customerNumber having count(*)<5

how to fetch data from multiple tables. 

when we fetch data from multiple tables then it is called join operations between tables. there are many type of join we can use between tables 

Ram 
    A,B,C,D 

Shyam 
    C,D,E,F 

1) equi/Inner join 
    when we want to fetch data from multiple tables based upon common fields between tables it is called equi join. here it fetch only matching value from both tables 

2) Left join 
   we want to fetch data from two tables, we want to fetch all rows from left side table where we want to fetch only matching rows from right side tables based upon common field 

3) Right join 
   we want to fetch data from two tables, we want to fetch all rows from right side table and we want to fetch only matching rows from left side tables based upon common field 

4) full join 
    we want to fetch all rows from two tables without giving any condition on common fields at that time we use full join. it do cartisan product operation on both tables.


examples 
1) fetch customerNumber,customerName and his payment detail. 
select customerNumber,customerName from customers
select * from payments 
join query 
select c.customerNumber,customerName, p.* from customers c, payments p where c.customerNumber=p.customerNumber

2) fetch customerNumber,customerName,country and his order detail 
select customerNumber,customerName,country from customers
select * from orders 

let us join 
select c.customerNumber,customerName,country,o.* from customers c, orders o where c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber


3) fetch customerNumber,customerName,country and his shipped order detail of usa customers 
select customerNumber,customerName,country from customers c where country='usa'
select * from orders o where status='shipped'

select c.customerNumber,customerName,country,o.* from customers c,orders o where country='usa' and status='shipped' and c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber

4)  fetch customerNumber,customerName,country, orderNumber, orderDate, Status and item detail of orders & product name

select customerNumber,customerName,country from customers
select orderNumber,orderDate,status from orders o
select orderNumber,productCode from orderdetails od
select productName from products p 

let us merge them 
select c.customerNumber,customerName,country,o.orderNumber,orderDate,status,od.productCode,productName  from customers c, orders o,orderdetails od,products p where c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber and o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber and p.productCode=od.productCode

findout customerNumber and customerName of those customer who have ordered 1940s Ford truck
select customerNumber,customerName from customers
select * from products where productName='1940s Ford truck'

select c.customerNumber,customerName,productName from customers c, products p,orderdetails od, orders o where productName='1940s Ford truck' and c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber and o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber and od.productCode=p.productCode


left join examples
---------------------------
fetch customerNumber,customerName of those customer who has never given any orders 
select customerNumber,customerName  from customers c 
select orderNumber from orders o 

select c.customerNumber,customerName,orderNumber  from customers c left join orders o on c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber where orderNumber is null

fetch customerNumber,customerName of those customer who has never given any payments 


display product which has been never ordered 
select productCode,productName from products p 
select orderNumber from orderdetails od

select  p.productCode,productName,orderNumber from products p left join orderdetails od on p.productCode=od.productCode where orderNumber is null 


Right Join 
findout orders in which customerNumber is not valid 
select customerNumber from orders 0 
select customerName from customers c

select customerName,o.customerNumber from customers c right join orders o on c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber where customerName is NULL;

we want to display each customername and product name he can ordered 
select customerName from customers c 
select productName from products p 

let us join them 
select customerName,productName from customers c, products p  

fetch details of customers who has given orders but never paid.
fetch customers(customerNumber,customerName) who has given orders 
select customerNumber,customerName from customers 
select orderNumber from orders o 

join 
select c.customerNumber,customerName,orderNumber from customers c, orders o  where c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber


now let us fetch payment 
select amount from payments p 

join 

select c.customerNumber,customerName,amount from customers c INNER JOIN orders o  ON c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber LEFT JOIN payments p on c.customerNumber = p.customerNumber WHERE amount is NULL GROUP BY c.customerNumber, customerName

fetch customerNumber,customerName,total received payments and total pending payment

1st get receive payment total 
select customerNumber,customerName from customers c
select customerNumber,sum(amount) from payments p group by customerNumber

total payment amount 

select c.customerNumber,customerName,sum(amount) from customers c inner join payments p on c.customerNumber=p.customerNumber group by c.customerNumber;

2nd get customerNumber and name and total order amount 
select customerNumber,customerName from customers c
select orderNumber from orders o 
select orderNumber,sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach) from orderdetails d group by orderNumber

select o.customerNumber,o.orderNumber,sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach) from orders o inner join orderdetails od on o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber group by o.orderNumber

let us join both sql join statement 

select o.customerNumber,sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach) as 'total order amount',sum(amount) as 'total payments'  from orders o inner join orderdetails od on o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber inner join payments p on o.customerNumber = p.customerNumber group by o.customerNumber

select o.customerNumber,sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach) as 'total order amount',sum(amount) as 'total payments', sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach) - sum(amount) as difference   from orders o inner join orderdetails od on o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber inner join payments p on o.customerNumber = p.customerNumber group by o.customerNumber

sub query
---------------------------------------
sub query means when we use one select statement inside another select statement. select statement which display fields is called outer query and select statement inside 1st select statement is called sub query 

findout & display details of work mates of employee Andy.

select officecode from employees e where firstname='Andy'
select * from employees e where officecode=6

select * from employees e where officecode=(select officecode from employees e where firstname='Andy') and firstname!='Andy'

findout all customers name,country,state,city of those customers who in same country as Mini Wheels
select customerName,country,state,city from customers 
select country from customers where customername='Mini wheels'

select customerName,country,state,city from customers where country = (select country from customers where customername='Mini wheels') and customerName!='Mini wheels'


findout customerNumber, and total payment amount of those customers who have made below total payment of customerNumber 112
select customerNumber,sum(amount) as 'total_payments' from payments group by customerNumber
select sum(amount) from payments where customerNumber=112

select customerNumber,sum(amount) as 'total_payments' from payments  group by customerNumber having sum(amount)< (select sum(amount) from payments where customerNumber=112)

findout customerNumber,customername,no of orders of those customers who have given more orders then Mini Wheels 
select customerNumber,customerName from customers c 
select customerNumber,count(*) from orders o group by customerNumber

select customerNumber from customers where customername='mini wheels'
select count(*) from orders where customerNumber=129

select count(*) from customers c,orders o where customername='mini wheels' and c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber

select c.customerNumber,customerName,count(o.customerNumber) from customers c, orders o where c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber group by o.customerNumber; 


select c.customerNumber,customerName,count(o.customerNumber) from customers c, orders o where c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber group by o.customerNumber having count(o.customerNumber)>(select count(*) from customers c,orders o where customername='mini wheels' and c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber
);
