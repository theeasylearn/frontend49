About Us

RangRoop has been a trusted name in women’s beauty and wellness since 2000. Based in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, we have spent more than two decades redefining what a modern beauty salon can be. Our mission has always been simple yet powerful: to combine expertise, innovation, and care to bring out the best in every woman who walks through our doors.

What started as a single vision has today grown into a spacious 2,000 square foot, centrally air-conditioned salon that reflects elegance, comfort, and professionalism. Every detail of RangRoop has been designed to create an experience that feels welcoming, relaxing, and memorable.

Our greatest strength lies in our people. With a dedicated team of 20+ highly skilled beauty therapists, each with an average of five years’ professional experience, we ensure that every client receives the highest standard of care. From routine services to advanced treatments, our team blends technical expertise with personal attention, making sure you feel both beautiful and confident.

Over the years, we have achieved remarkable milestones that speak to our commitment and passion. RangRoop has proudly served more than 50,000 satisfied customers, a number that continues to grow every day. We are also ISO certified, which reflects our dedication to maintaining the highest quality standards in service, safety, and hygiene. Our salon is equipped with the latest technology and tools, ensuring that we always stay ahead of trends and deliver results that meet global benchmarks.

Recognition has been a natural part of our journey. RangRoop has been honored with two prestigious state government awards and one national award for excellence in bridal (Dulhan) makeup. These accolades are more than trophies to us—they are reminders of the trust our clients place in us, and the responsibility we carry to uphold that trust. Our bridal services, in particular, have become a hallmark of our salon, where we blend tradition with contemporary styles to create unforgettable looks for life’s most special moments.

Beyond awards and milestones, RangRoop has also had the privilege of serving well-known personalities from the world of entertainment and sports. From Dhollywood stars to Bollywood actors and even sportspersons, our salon has welcomed celebrities who value privacy, professionalism, and artistry. These experiences inspire us to constantly raise our standards and keep innovating in everything we do.

At the heart of RangRoop is a simple belief: beauty is not just about appearance—it’s about confidence, self-care, and the joy of feeling like the best version of yourself. Whether you are preparing for a wedding, updating your everyday look, or simply indulging in some well-deserved pampering, our team is here to guide you, support you, and deliver results you will love.

RangRoop is proud to be a part of Bhavnagar’s growing culture of beauty and wellness, and we look forward to welcoming many more clients into our family. For us, every visit is not just an appointment—it’s an opportunity to help you shine brighter.
