                <h2>India Responds to New US Tariffs Amidst Geopolitical Tensions</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A major focus of today's news is the new round of tariffs imposed by the US on India. President Donald
                Trump has levied an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, bringing the total to 50%, citing India's
                continued purchase of Russian oil. India has officially responded, calling the move "unfair,
                unjustified, and unreasonable," and has stated its commitment to taking all necessary actions to protect
                its national interests, including those of its farmers and fishermen. The move has sparked a political
                debate within India, with the opposition criticizing the government's foreign policy.</p>

            <p>Rescue and relief operations are underway in parts of Uttarakhand after a devastating cloudburst and
                flash floods. Reports indicate that several people are missing, and a number of people have been
                rescued. The difficult weather conditions, including continuous heavy rainfall and damaged
                infrastructure, are posing significant challenges to the rescue teams from the NDRF and the Army.</p>

                <h2>Political Spat Escalates Over Voter Rolls and Election Commission's Role</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A political dispute is intensifying over claims of voter fraud. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has
                accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of colluding with the ruling party to manipulate
                electoral rolls, a claim that the ECI has asked him to substantiate with evidence. The BJP has
                vehemently denied these allegations, calling them baseless. This comes as the Supreme Court has also
                weighed in, asking the ECI to respond to a petition regarding the deletion of names from the Bihar voter
                list.</p>

                redevelopment project, which aims to modernize government infrastructure in the capital.</p>

                <h2>RBI Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged to Combat Inflation</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In a decision aimed at tackling persistent inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced it
                will keep the repo rate unchanged. This move, which will likely keep loan interest rates stable for the
                time being, is part of a broader strategy to maintain price stability in the country's economy. The
                RBI's decision comes amidst global economic pressures and concerns about the impact of new international
                tariffs.</p>
